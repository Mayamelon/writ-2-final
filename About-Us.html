            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <h3>When Cyan Customer-Circuits was founded in 2028, we had a vision to change the world of marketing and advertisment forever. Now, after eight years, our dream has come true. Our goal is to help business collect data from their customers most effectively so that they can make their business as profitable as possible. To this end, our business model involves selling our products and services at a loss to businesses. We make this profit back by selling the data to third party advertisment partners.</h3>
